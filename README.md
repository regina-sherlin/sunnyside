# Sunnyside Landing Page

Website URL 🚀 -  https://regina-sherlin.github.io/sunnyside/


# What is this project? 
  ▪️ This website is built for a fictional website as a design challenge from - [FrontEnd Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/sunnyside-agency-landing-page-7yVs3B6ef)
  ▪️ My task was to build the website as close to the design as possible. The designs were shared as figma assets and I had to translate it into a functioning website.
  
# What is it built with? 🏗️
  ▪️ It was built with HTML, CSS (pre-processors like SASS) and JavaScript
 
# What have I learnt in the process? 🤸
  ▪️ I have learnt about CSS Flexbox in this process. I have a decent grasp of how I can use flexbox for the base layout of a webpage.
  ▪️ I am more confident with using assets like svg, png now as it has become familiar.
  ▪️ I have looked for details and mostly eyeballed the design elements and replicated the design.
  ▪️ I think I am more comfortable with building a basic format and structure of a landing page.
 
 # Things to add in the future ⌚
 ▪️ I would like to make it responsive for mobile device screens. This was one of my old projects. 
 I tried to give it a decent shape for desktop screens. I need to do the same for mobile screens as well.
